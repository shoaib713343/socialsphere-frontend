##SocialSphere - Full-Stack Social Media Platform üöÄ
Live Demo: https://socialsphere-frontend.vercel.app/

SocialSphere is a feature-rich, production-grade, full-stack social media application. Built with a Modular Monolith backend architecture and a modern React frontend, this project is a portfolio centerpiece designed to showcase a deep understanding of scalable, real-time, and secure web systems.

The entire stack is containerized with Docker, featuring a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, demonstrating professional DevOps practices.

‚ú® Core Features
üîê Authentication & Security (Full-Stack)
Multi-Factor Registration: Sign up with Email/Password or Google (OAuth 2.0).

Professional Verification Flow: Unverified users are restricted from app features and redirected to a "Please Verify" page with a "Resend Email" option. Clicking the verification link automatically logs the user in.

Secure JWT Authentication: Implements short-lived accessTokens (15m) and long-lived, secure, httpOnly cookie-based refreshTokens (7d).

Silent Token Refresh: The frontend uses an Axios interceptor to automatically and silently refresh expired tokens, ensuring a seamless user experience without unexpected logouts.

Secure Password Reset: A full "Forgot Password" and "Reset Password" flow using secure, single-use tokens sent via email.

üìù Content & Social Graph
Rich Media Posts: Users can create posts with text, images, or videos.

Cloud Media Storage: All media is uploaded to and served from Cloudinary.

User Discovery & Profiles: A dedicated "Users" page to find and follow others, and dynamic profile pages to view user information and their posts.

Follow/Unfollow System: A complete social graph where users can follow and unfollow each other, with optimistic UI updates for an instant response.

Dynamic Feeds: A tabbed interface to switch between multiple feeds:

Public Feed: A global, paginated feed of all posts.

Following Feed: A personalized feed showing posts only from followed users.

Trending Feed: A feed generated by a complex MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline based on recent engagement.

Reels Feed: A dedicated feed for video-only content.

Interactive Posts: Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback on liking posts and a full comment modal to view all comments with author details.

‚ö° Real-Time Systems (Full-Stack via Socket.IO)
Live One-on-One Chat: A complete, private messaging system.

Persistent Conversation List: The chat page displays a list of all followed users and past chat partners, not just who is currently online.

Live Presence System: A green dot indicates which users in the conversation list are currently online.

Typing Indicators: See when the other user is typing a message in real-time.

Real-Time Notifications: A notification bell in the navbar shows a badge and a dropdown list when another user likes or comments on your post, all in real-time.

‚öôÔ∏è DevOps & Professional Practices
Fully Containerized: The entire backend stack (Node.js App, MongoDB, Redis) is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

CI/CD Pipeline: A full Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.

CI: On every push, the backend code is automatically tested using Jest and Supertest.

CD: Successful pushes to the main branch are automatically deployed to a live server on Render.

Clean Architecture: The backend follows a modular structure (routes, controllers, services) for maintainability and scalability.

üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

Docker Desktop

Git

Backend Setup
Clone the backend repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/shoaib713343/socialsphere-backend.git
cd socialsphere-backend
Create your environment file: Copy the example .env.example file to a new .env file and fill in your keys for Cloudinary, Google, and Mailtrap.

Bash

cp .env.example .env
Run the application with Docker Compose: This command builds the images and starts the Node.js application, MongoDB database, and Redis cache.

Bash

docker-compose up --build
The backend API will be running at http://localhost:8000.

Frontend Setup
Clone the frontend repository in a separate terminal:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/shoaib713343/socialsphere-frontend.git
cd socialsphere-frontend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Run the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
